/**
 * Ticket 0005 — SaveGameV1.

 * PROTECTED CONTRACT (spec 1060–1066): save format.
 *
 * Spec 1108–1140: saves carry an explicit schema version, migrations are tested,
 * and old dynasties should stay loadable whenever possible. The rule that follows
 * from that: never repurpose or narrow an existing field. Add a field, bump the
 * version, write a migration, keep the old reader working.
